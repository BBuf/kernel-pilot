# Veitner Load And Store PR Knowledge Notes

Repository: <https://github.com/simveit/load_and_store>

This page is the production-PR layer for kernel-knowledge. It favors merged PRs that changed kernels, dispatch, JIT/runtime integration, tuning policy, tests, benchmarks, or profiling evidence. Release, CI-only, formatting, pure version-bump, and non-target-backend PRs are filtered out.

## Per-PR Ledger Fields

When using an idea from this page, add one row to `artifacts/source-idea-ledger.md` with:

| Field | Value to record |
| --- | --- |
| Source key | `<repo>#<pr-number>` |
| Code evidence | Kernel, wrapper, benchmark, and test paths opened from the PR diff |
| Hypothesis | The concrete optimization idea derived from the PR |
| First experiment | Candidate version and benchmark shape set |
| Result | Correctness, geomean, best/worst cases, and NCU digest path |
| Do-not-reread key | Same as source key unless a single PR yields multiple independent ideas |

## How To Use This Page

- During the initial knowledge pass, read the category matching the target kernel and copy PR URL, changed paths, and hypothesis into the source idea ledger.
- During plateau expansion, choose PRs not already present in ledger do-not-reread keys; inspect the diff, linked issue, changed tests, and benchmark files before using the idea.
- Treat PR code as baseline/prior art unless the task and license allow copying or adapting it. When copied, record exact PR, commit, files, notice, and first delta.
