# KernelPilot

KernelPilot is a small, stdlib-only framework for agent-driven kernel
optimization. It is designed to work with coding agents such as Codex, Claude
Code, OpenCode, or any comparable agent that can read files, edit code, run
commands, and preserve iteration state.

The core workflow is:

1. define one kernel task with semantic spec, forbidden source files,
   correctness gates, benchmark cases, and target speedup;
2. generate a focused agent prompt from task metadata, source references, and
   lineage;
3. implement one candidate at a time from the semantic spec;
4. run correctness first, then benchmark every configured case;
5. record both wins and failed directions so the next iteration has context.

## Layout

- `kernelpilot/`: task config loader, prompt builder, lineage store, scoring,
  knowledge-base rendering, and stagnation hints.
- `references/`: method notes plus the kernel-source catalog used as reference
  map before edits.
- `templates/`: reusable prompts, including the agent goal prompt template.

Task directories and run artifacts are intentionally user-created inputs. Keep
operator-specific reproductions, lineage, and benchmark results outside the
framework tree unless they are meant to be reviewed as examples.

## Contract

KernelPilot intentionally separates semantics from existing optimized kernel
implementations.

A candidate starts from:

- the operator semantic spec in the task file;
- a trusted reference expression or test oracle;
- benchmark shape and dtype contracts;
- previous lineage entries, if any;
- approved reference material such as FlashInfer, FlashAttention,
  Tencent `hpc-ops`, DeepGEMM, and local GPU-kernel references.

A candidate must not copy or pattern-match from the optimized baseline kernel or the
current target implementation. Target-project tests and wrappers may be used as
correctness or integration oracles after the candidate exists.

## Knowledge Base

Print the relevant reference map before editing:

```bash
python -m kernelpilot.cli refs --lane "CUDA C++ JIT"
```

The current catalog includes:

- user-configured local GPU-kernel reference docs;
- user-configured target kernel project worktree;
- verified public kernel repositories: FlashInfer, FlashAttention,
  Tencent `hpc-ops` / hi-ops, and DeepGEMM;
- target-project source is treated as an integration and validation oracle, not
  as an external kernel reference.

## Minimal Use

Validate a task set:

```bash
python -m kernelpilot.cli validate \
  --taskset <taskset.json>
```

Generate the next iteration prompt for a task:

```bash
python -m kernelpilot.cli prompt \
  --taskset <taskset.json> \
  --task <task-id>
```

Compare a candidate benchmark JSON against the matching baseline:

```bash
python -m kernelpilot.cli compare \
  --taskset <taskset.json> \
  --task <task-id> \
  --result <candidate-result.json>
```

Expected candidate result format:

```json
{
  "correct": true,
  "measurements": [
    {"case_id": "n=4194304", "latency_us": 10.9}
  ]
}
```

## Goal Prompt Template

Use [templates/kernel-goal-prompt.md](templates/kernel-goal-prompt.md)
as the top-level goal for your coding agent. Fill in the operator, target
speedup, hardware, baseline, and validation requirements; the agent can then
keep iterating until the gate is met.
